# MSG-STYLEGAN-TF

### Why this repository?
So, our previous research work released the 
[BMSG-GAN](https://github.com/akanimax/BMSG-GAN) code in PyTorch.
This repository applies the Multi-scale Gradient connections 
in StyleGAN. The switch to Tensorflow was primarily to ensure an
apples-to-apples comparison with StyleGAN. 

### Due Credit
This code heavily uses NVIDIA's original 
[StyleGAN](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan) code. We accredit and
acknowledge their work here. The [Original License]() is located in 
the base directory (file named `LICENSE_ORIGINAL.txt`).
